Cipher block chaining works by XORing the previous block of ciphertext with the current block. You might recognise that the first block has nothing to be XOR’d with; enter the **initialisation vector**. This comprises a number of randomly-generated bytes of data the same size as the cipher’s block size. This initialisation vector should random enough that it cannot be recovered.\n",

You should know that the more entropy sources that are available (such as network traffic and disk activity), the faster the system can generate cryptographically-secure random data. I’ve written a function that can generate a nonce suitable for use as an initialisation vector. This will work on a Linux machine; the comments note how easy it is to adapt it to a Windows machine. This function requires a version of PyCrypto at least 2.1.0 or higher."

The easiest way is to just base64 encode everything in the encrypt function. Everything that goes into the decrypt function should be in base64 - if it’s not, the base64 module will throw an error: you could catch this and then try to decode it as binary data.\n",
